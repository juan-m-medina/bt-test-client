# What this repo is about

This is an example for a "Hosted Fields" client for using Google Pay on a Braintree account.

# Setup

- Install Node if you don't have it - https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
- This client relies on the matching server found at https://github.com/juan-m-medina/bt-test-server.
- Clone the repo to a location of your choice.
- Create a ```config.json``` file to the url/endpoint for the server you are using. Example for TEST below. For PRODUCTION make sure to update the values accordingly.
  ```
  config = {  
    "environment": "TEST", 
    "merchantId": "_type_here_your_google_merchant_id_can_be_empty_on_test_",
    "tokenEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000/token",  
    "customerEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000/customer"
  }  
  ```
- Run `npx http-server`. This should install all the necessary node dependencies
- You should get output that looks something like this:
  ```
  ‚ùØ npx http-server
  npx: installed 23 in 3.044s
